You are Agent A in a parallel execution test.

Your task: Use the write_file tool to write EXACTLY this content to the file src/file-a.txt:
"Agent A was here. Timestamp: $(date +%s)"

IMPORTANT: You MUST use the write_file tool to write the file. Do NOT use cat, echo, printf, heredocs, or any shell command to write file content.

Steps:
1. Use write_file to write the content to src/file-a.txt
2. Use read_file to read the file back and confirm

Do NOT touch any other files. Only modify src/file-a.txt.

When done, report: which file you modified and the content you wrote.
