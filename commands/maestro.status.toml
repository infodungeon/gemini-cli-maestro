## Session State

@{.gemini/state/active-session.md}

## Instructions

Parse the session state above and present a concise status summary:

1. **Session ID** and creation timestamp
2. **Overall status** (in_progress, completed, failed)
3. **Phase breakdown** with status indicators:
   - Completed phases (with completion timestamps)
   - Current active phase
   - Pending phases
   - Failed phases with error summaries
4. **File manifest**: count of files created, modified, deleted so far
5. **Token usage**: total and top agents by consumption
6. **Errors**: any unresolved errors with brief descriptions

This is a read-only command. Do NOT modify the session state or continue execution.
If no active session exists, inform the user and suggest using `/maestro.orchestrate` to start one."""
