prompt = """Archive the current active orchestration session.

Activate the `session-management` skill and follow its archive protocol.

## Execution

1. Check for an active session at `.gemini/state/active-session.md`
2. If no active session exists, inform the user that there is nothing to archive
3. If an active session exists:
   - Read the session state and present a brief summary of what will be archived
   - Ask the user to confirm archival (the session may have incomplete phases)
   - Execute the archive protocol from the session-management skill:
     - Move design document to `.gemini/plans/archive/`
     - Move implementation plan to `.gemini/plans/archive/`
     - Update session status to `completed`
     - Move session state to `.gemini/state/archive/<session-id>.md`
   - Verify archival was successful (no active-session.md remains)
   - Confirm to the user with a summary of what was archived"""
