prompt = """Resume the Maestro orchestration session.

Activate the `session-management` and `execution` skills.

## Session State

@{.gemini/state/active-session.md}

## Resume Protocol

1. Parse the session state above to determine:
   - session_id and overall status
   - current_phase and which phases are completed
   - Any errors from previous execution
   - File manifest of changes made so far
   - Token usage to date
2. Present a concise status summary to the user:
   - Session ID and creation timestamp
   - Phase-by-phase status (completed, in_progress, failed, pending)
   - Any unresolved errors
   - What will happen next
3. If errors exist from the last run, present them and ask for guidance before retrying
4. Continue execution from the last active/pending phase using the execution skill's protocols
5. Activate the `delegation` skill when delegating to subagents
6. Activate the `validation` skill to verify phase outputs

If no active session exists, inform the user and suggest using `/maestro.orchestrate` to start one."""
